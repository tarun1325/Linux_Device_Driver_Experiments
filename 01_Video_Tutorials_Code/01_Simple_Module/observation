This is Observation File of Learning Linux Device Drivers Development - 01. Simple Module

1. To shorten Path : PS1="\u \W $" (u for username, w for workspace)
2. Learning about Screen Utility in Terminal.

	* sudo apt install screen
	* exit - to terminate a Bash
	* :remove - to remove a particular split
	* Press 'ctrl+a' before every command
	* 'S' - split horizontally
	* '|' - split vertically
	* 'A' - rename Bash title
	* '"' - bash list to switch
	* 'c' - start terminal in new bash
	* 'TAB' - switch tabs
	* 'Space' - Go to Next Bash
	* 'Crtl+n' - Go to nth Bash
	* '?' - Help to see all commands

3. Learnt Vim Editor for working on Terminal efficiently.
	* vimdiff file1 file2 - to see the difference
	

4. Building Simple Modules:
	* C file including two function init() and exit().
	* Load and Unload modules in Kernel. 
	* Name of your init and exit function can be anything
	* Register those Function with Kernel init and exit function Macros.

5. Creating Make File (ScreenShot)
	* Study GNU Make - MakeFile syntax. 
	* Some Obsevation - The directory in which you have created your module's C File. Should not contain spaces in its name.Otherwise Error occurs which is displayed below.
	* Specify Loadable Module Objects.
	* Specify condition for CROSS_COMPILE as given in makefile.

6. Error Occurred during Compilation/Build:
	* Possible Reason:
		- Name of Directory has Spaces
		- Makefile syntax wrong for $(pwd) 
		- pwd is written in capital letters
		- Cross compilation is enabled
		- Clean should have a command, not a file

	Error: (ScreenShot)
	arch/x86/Makefile:148: CONFIG_X86_X32 enabled but no binutils support
	Makefile:676: Cannot use CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG: -fstack-protector-strong not supported by compiler

7. Files Created on Successfull Compilation/Build:

	* ex01_simple_module.ko
	* ex01_simple_module.mod.c
	* ex01_simple_module.mod.o
	* ex01_simple_module.o
	* Module.symvers
	* modules.order

8. Load/Unload/View Module into kernel
	* Load - sudo insmod ./ex01_simple_module.ko (ScreenShot)
	* View - lsmod ( See topmost module)	(ScreenShot)
	* Unload - sudo rmmod ex01_simple_module (ScreenShot)

9. Output printed using printk() can be found in /var/log/syslog
	* tail -f /var/log/syslog

10. To Do
	* Study Full GNU Make Book
		- echo $(pwd), echo ${PWD}, echo $(shell pwd) 
		- Understand Makefile rules for them.
		- make --help
	* Find out all the files created on Build ?
	* Find out why Module.symvers, modules.order ?
	* Find CargoCult ?
	* Learn to write scripts.
	* Study README file of Linux Kernel 4.x
